# Library Database Program with Python

## Problem Statement: 
A library wants to create a database system to manage their collection of books. They want to create a program that allows them to add, update, and delete books in their collection.

## Solution:
We can use Python programming language to create a CRUD system for the library's database. The CRUD system will allow the librarian to perform the following operations:
 - Create: Add new books to the library's collection.
 - Read: Display the books in the library's collection. 
 - Update: Modify the details of a book in the library's collection.
 - Delete: Remove a book from the library's collection.
 
## Implementation
1.  **Creating a database:** The first step is to create a database to store the library's collection of books. We can use SQLite, which is a light-weight database engine that is easy to use with Python. We can create a database called "library.db" using the following code:

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

2.  **Adding a book to the database:** We can add a new book to the database using the INSERT INTO statement. Here's an example:

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

3.  **Displaying the Books in database:** We can display all the books in the database using the SELECT statement. Here's an example:

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```
4.  **Updating a database:** We can update the details of a book in the database using the UPDATE statement. Here's an example:

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

5.  **Deleting a book from database:** We can delete a book from the database using the DELETE statement. Here's an example:

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```
